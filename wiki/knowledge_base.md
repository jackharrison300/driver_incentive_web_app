# Misc Unsorted Notes

- Leverage as many AWS services as possible? Or just cobble things together?
- I hate UI unit tests, but I am a proponent of TDD for backend / code heavy
- Authorization / Authentication
- AWS Cognito
- To really get much use out of this we also have to lean heavy into AWS API Gateway or Lambda
- Using Cognito means we have to adopt an AWS heavy architecture
- https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/
- Passport.js
- Tons of options for auth (I think using JWT would be best)
- More setup work, but more flexibility w/ architecture
- https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-jwt/
- Some out of the box Express thing?
- Lambda + AWS API Gateway
- AWS CloudWatch / DynamoDB for logs?
- RDS MySQL
