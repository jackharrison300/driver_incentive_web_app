# Express research

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is an unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.js.

The home page contains several helpdul pages including setup, a hello world example, an FAQ, and of course how to use all the contents of express.

The express framework is particularly helpful when trying to add handling for some different HTTP verbs or seperate URL paths, serve static files, use templates to dynamically 
create the response and interact with rendering engines, set common web app settings like the ports or template locations, or add request processing "middleware".
How to do all of this and more is explained [here, in another tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction#what_does_express_code_look_like).

For those more inclined to learn via videos, [here's a 35 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SccSCuHhOw0).
