# Remix research

[Remix](https://remix.run/) is a full-stack web developement framework with the main goal of producing lightning fast loading speeds. 
Though it also has goals of being super easy to use for both front and back end developement.
It's main features are file-based route handling, a loader function for GET verbs, an action function for POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE verbs, 
and the special ability to nest routes, which allows for several files to be loaded synchronously, reducing loading time. More info about these features can be 
found [here](https://blog.bitsrc.io/is-remix-the-next-framework-you-have-to-learn-3e7dca13e9d1#:~:text=What%20is%20Remix%3F,ish%20flavor%20to%20your%20code.).

[This webpage](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1) actually has several tutorials. There's a quickstart to teach the basics, 
a full guide that has you building a full jokes app, and API information.

Again, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_BhzHVV4aQ) is an hour long crash course for the more video-learning inclined.
