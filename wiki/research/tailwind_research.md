# Tailwind research

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a framework for CSS which aims to increase ease of coding in css by adding semi-complex functions, classes, and variables. 
These include rotate-90, text-center, sizings, colors, fonts, and shadows. It even has the ability to easily give a site [dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode).

The tailwind webpage has instructions for both [installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and [setup](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup). 
It also has several pieces of information on all the different [layout elements](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio), [spacing](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding), 
[typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family), and [more](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-attachment).

Due to the mass of what tailwind can accomplish, the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gpXORlEHjc5bgnIi5HEGhw) 
is a 19-episode series of 5-10 minute tutorials.
