# MySQL research

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open source database management system. Its main features are in being a relational database, which means that it stores data across multiple stores 
instead of one big table. It even allows you to manage the relations between various data fields.

A [full tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/mySQl/default.asp) can be found on w3schools.com. It goes through all the elements of MySQL one by one, with a full breakdown of each element 
being given its own webpage. It even contains a [quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/mySQl/mysql_quiz.asp) at the end of the tutorial.

Unfortunately, the shortest [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER8oKX5myE0) that I could find is about 2 hours long, but it is a complete course on MySQL.
